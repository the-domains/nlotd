Amazon today announced the launch of its AWS Mobile Hub based on AWS Lambda at its re:Invent developer conference, a new tool that makes it easier for mobile developer to build the back-end processes for their apps. As Amazon CTO Werner Vogels noted during today's keynote, AWS has long offered developers all of the services to run a backend for mobile apps, but those weren't always easy to use. "What we see often is that mobile developers are really good on the device," he said. "They find that backend stuff really hard. So we asked ourselves: what can we do to make mobile development much simpler."
